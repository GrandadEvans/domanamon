## Domain management tool

### The plan
The plan is for this to be a domain monitor and management tool.
I want it to:

* provide an up to date screenshot
* domain expiry etc
* status
* price paid and estimates value
* host and server
* Github status
* CI/Tests status
* many other features that I have seen on a few other tools

It will:

* use Test Driven Development (TDD)
* use Open Object Programming
* be written within the SOLID guidelines
* use the PSRs
* initially be open source but may become Software As A Service (SAAS)


### Actions Completed
* Baseline for the phpunit test suite created
* YouTrack issue tracker set up as subdomain locally until remote set up
